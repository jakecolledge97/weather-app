## Description

This website contains a simple yet functional weather forecast application. When you search for a city it will display the temperature and other weatherly information for the current day, plus another 5-Day forecast. This uses the CSS framework Bulma, and JQuery for styling and functions, and uses the openweathermap API for all the weather details. This helped my learn how to use third-party CSS and server API's.

## Assets
